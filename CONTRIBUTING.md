## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Use **Black** for code formatting:
  ```bash
  black src/ tests/ scripts/ app/
  ```

- Use **Flake8** for linting:
  ```bash
  flake8 src/ tests/ scripts/ app/
  ```

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Docstring Format
Use NumPy-style docstrings:

```python
def calculate_confidence(self, gift: Dict, sentiment: float, size: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate confidence score for gift recommendation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gift : Dict
        Gift information dictionary
    sentiment : float
        Sentiment score between 0 and 1
    size : str
        Hand size category ('small', 'medium', 'large')

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Confidence score between 0 and 1

    Examples
    --------
    >>> engine = RecommendationEngine(gift_db)
    >>> confidence = engine.calculate_confidence(gift, 0.8, "small")
    >>> print(confidence)
    0.85
    """
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_nlp/test_preprocessor.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Use fixtures for common test data

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
from src.nlp.preprocessor import TextPreprocessor

class TestTextPreprocessor:

    def setup_method(self):
        self.processor = TextPreprocessor()

    def test_clean_text_removes_urls(self):
        text = "Check this out https://example.com"
        result = self.processor.clean_text(text)
        assert "https://" not in result
```
